### Computational Biophysics

Computational Biophysics is the Middle School Science project my group worked on. This is the first post about a blog that is about
Middle School Science in my 7th grade class. During the time before the first Middle School Science Exploratorium, Me and my team has
worked hard on this Computational Biophysics. We have worked hard on a **_college level_** science experiment.
