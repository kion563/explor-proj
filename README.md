# The Exploratorium Project
### Computational Biophysics

Computational Biophysics. Sounds weird right? What is it? Well, Computational Biophysics is when we take computers and we use the
computers to create something amazing. We use Biology and Genetics in this project based on Computational Biophysics and this is 
not easy at all. This is a very long process. We used all the time we had to work on this. We even work in advance.
